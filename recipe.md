2. Place the salami slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow some space between the slices.
3. Place a mound of shredded cheese on top of every slice, about 1–2 tablespoons. Sprinkle paprika powder or dry herbs on top if you want additional flavors.
4. Place in the oven and bake until the cheese turns bubbly and golden brown. Keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.
5. Remove from the oven and let cool. After that the chips are ready to be enjoyed!

##Tip!

_**You can use any kind or shredded cheese you want – common cheddar, aged cheddar,  
shredded mozarella cheese, parmesan cheese or you can mix different cheeses.  
You’ll get best results from a mix of cheddar and parmesan cheese.  
You may also top with something else, for example taco mix, onion or garlic powder or black pepper.**_
